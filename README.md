# UNLV Political Science Math Introduction

This repository contains a draft of the UNLV political science math introduction. This project's purpose is to be a helpful guide for incoming political science students at UNLV. It will take readers through the basic math skills that would help them as they go into their research methods courses (PSC 701 and 702). As such, the document will have relevant subject matter for both courses. This document can also act as a reference for UNLV political science students who have already taken the relevant methods courses but would like a math review.

**Please note: this repository is a work in progress.** I will update this as I find the time. My goal is to work on this in spare office hours I have as the department methods TA.

## The `math_intro` Folder

The `math_intro` folder contains the `qmd` and rendered `pdf` versions of the document. It is here where one should make primary edits to the document.

If this project expands at some point in the future, it would be worthwhile splitting the `qmd` file into sub-documents pertaining to the given chapter in the final document--especially if you follow the outline as it is currently laid out. This would facilitate organization and editing. It would also make rendering easier. For now, though, the `qmd` will stay as a single document.

## The `outline` Folder

The `outline` folder contains the outline in an `Rmd` file. This should be the primary focus before drafting begins on the primary document.
