# UNLV Political Science Math Introduction

This repository contains a draft of the UNLV political science math introduction.

## The `math_intro` Folder

The `math_intro` folder contains the `qmd` and rendered `pdf` versions of the document. It is here where one should make primary edits to the document.

If this project expands at some point in the future, it would be worthwhile splitting the `qmd` file into sub-documents pertaining to the given chapter in the final document--especially if you follow the outline as it is currently laid out. This would facilitate organization and editing. It would also make rendering easier. For now, though, the `qmd` will stay as a single document.

## The `outline` Folder

The `outline` folder contains the outline in an `Rmd` file. This should be the primary focus before drafting begins on the primary document.
